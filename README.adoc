You can use this project as an absolutely minimal and simple library for Python provisioning code for e.g. container images and containers.
For example, you can use it

* to mutate the state of a container (e.g., make filesystem changes related to mutable data) without using shell scripts, e.g. prior to starting a daemon process;
* to create a container image by mutating a container derived from a base image (e.g., a https://www.packer.io/[Packer]-based workflow).


== Properties

This package lays foundations for:

. logging;
. very easy, concise and functional subprocess execution (e.g., shell commands);
. exception handling/debugging.


=== Advantages

By writing provisioning code depending on this library, you and your team need minimal Python/system programming capability to automate image and container provisioning.
Your provisioning code will be minimalistic and flexible, but allow you to have the reliable yet complex provisioning process that may be required for real-world, possibly legacy deployments (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)[LAMP] stacks).

Other solutions are less attractive depending on your criteria.

. Domain-specific languages and frameworks:
.. durability questionable (e.g., major incompatible CM frameworks wax and wane in popularity).
.. needlessly non-standard (e.g., Dockerfiles).
. Shell scripting:
.. unreliable: defects arise from subtle platform differences;
.. less functional: no API but set of CLI utilities;
.. requires scarce competence and time investment to do well.
. Systems programming (e.g., C, C++, Go, Rust) languages: require scarce competence and possibly time investment to do well.

=== Disadvantages

By using this package your provisioning code will depend on Python 3, which is to some degree heavy, tricky to work with and slow compared to e.g. a  native code provisioning executable.

== To install the package

Currently, this package does not have https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools[`setuptools`] packaging.
This package is normally installed by copying the link:provisioning/[`provisioning`] package into the relevant CPython site directory (e.g., `/usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/`).


== Example

[source,python3]
----
#!/usr/bin/python3 -B

from provisioning import provision, sh_cmd

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with provision():
        print('This block contains your provisioning code. '
              'A log has been created at /build.log. ')
